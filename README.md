Indexer for information on names registered on the blockchain, the associated data, blockchain transactions etc

This is *not* a UI and is meant to provide only JSON interface for calls to a processed index (stored in a database). Examples of other block explorer are [Namecha.in](http://namecha.in).

WARNING: this repo is under rapid development and don't expect it to be useful straight away
